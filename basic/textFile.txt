The example above will fetch the first 10 lines of the file you have selected. 
This means streams can be very useful for handling large files or even slow resources 
like network resources.

The amount of functionality in the Enum and Stream modules can be daunting at first, 
but you will get familiar with them case by case. In particular, focus on the Enum 
module first and only move to Stream for the particular scenarios where laziness is 
required, to either deal with slow resources or large, possibly infinite, collections.

Next, weâ€™ll look at a feature central to Elixir, Processes, which allows us to write 
concurrent, parallel and distributed programs in an easy and understandable way.
